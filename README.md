## 🎯 Overview

The goal of this project was to **replicate the Amazon homepage** as closely as possible using only **HTML and CSS**, including:  

- Header with logo, search bar, and navigation links  
- Product sections with images, descriptions, and offers  
- Footer with multiple information links  
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile views  

This helped me improve my understanding of:  
- HTML semantic elements  
- CSS Flexbox and Grid for layouts  
- Responsive design with media queries  
- Styling images, text, and navigation menus
